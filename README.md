# MPA (Mercury Profile Analyser)

The Mercury Profile Analyser is a program dedicated to the analysis of height profiles. For now, only the CSV files exported by Veeco Dektak 8 Stylus Profilometers are supported for import. The software can plot the height profile, but also perform the main tasks that the commercial Veeco Dektak software is typically used for: levelling the profile and measuring averaged height differences.
